# diameter-of-graph
This is an school project which calculate the diameter of an directed-unweighted graph. 
We did not alowed to use Python exsiting libraries for this.
I used DFS for finding shortest path between all pair od nodes and then calculate the Longest shortest path(diameter).
The sample graph was a network of hypertext. (I could not uoload it since the size was too big)
